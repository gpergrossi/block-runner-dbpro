## Running the Game

I don't actually expect anyone to try to get this old game working. It was written more than 10
years ago when I was in middle school. Dark Basic Pro wasn't a well known language back then and 
it's even less supported now. 

### Option 1
If you have Windows 10 with Direct X installed, the "Application.exe" may just work for you.

### Option 2
If it doesn't work for you, you'll need to compile the project for yourself. This will require
[Dark Basic Pro](https://github.com/TheGameCreators/Dark-Basic-Pro) which is now open source.
In theory, it is possible to compile their editor with the right libraries installed on a
Windows machine. For me, the editor precompiled in their "Install" directory at the repository's
root worked just fine. If you need to compile their editor to get it working, good luck!
